TITLE: Sentiment-Analysis_Reviews-to-Insights
AUTHOR: Priyanka Rajeev Hichkad
---

It contains a collection of projects demonstrating Sentiment Analysis on reviews using both descriptive (rule-based) and predictive (ML/DL) approaches.

The datasets were sourced from Kaggle, ensuring access to diverse and authentic customer reviews. The primary objective of this repository is to explore multiple approaches to sentiment analysis, including descriptive (rule-based) and predictive (ML/DL) methods.

The goal is to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, transforming unstructured text into meaningful insights. By comparing rule-based analyzers, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models, this project highlights the strengths and trade-offs of each approach. Ultimately, the repository demonstrates how sentiment analysis can uncover valuable insights into public opinion, customer satisfaction, and overall brand perception, assisting businesses in improving services and enhancing customer experience.

## Projects-
- **TextBlob Sentiment Analysis** → McDonald’s Reviews Dataset (Kaggle), descriptive classification into positive, negative, neutral categories.
- **VADER Sentiment Analysis** → Amazon Fine Food Reviews (Kaggle), rule-based scoring and classification into sentiment categories.
- **Predictive Sentiment Analysis (ML Models)** → Applied Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, and SVC on VADER-processed dataset.
- **Predictive Sentiment Analysis (LSTM)** → Implemented LSTM neural network with NLP preprocessing for advanced sequence-based sentiment prediction.
